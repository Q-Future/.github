#### 📖 What have we published?

- **Q-Align**: [Homepage](https://q-align.github.io/), [Repo](https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Align). A unified visual scorer for images and videos, via text-instructed alignment on multi-modality foundation models; can efficiently fine-tune to more datasets with stable good performance. State-of-the-art on IQA, VQA, and IAA.

- **Q-Instruct**: [Homepage](https://q-future.github.io/Q-Instruct), [Repo](https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Instruct),  [200K Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/teowu/Q-Instruct), [Technical Report](https://q-future.github.io/Q-Instruct/fig/Q_Instruct_v0_1_preview.pdf) A large-scale instruction tuning dataset to improve low-level perceptual abilities of foundation models.

- **Q-Bench [ICLR2024, Spotlight]**: [Homepage](https://q-future.github.io/Q-Bench/), [Repo](https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Bench), [Data](https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Bench/releases/tag/v1.0.1.1014datarelease), [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14181) The first low-level benchmark for foundation models on low-level vision.

#### 🖋️ What are we working on?

- **[WIP]Chinese-Q-Bench/质衡**: [Homepage](https://q-future.github.io/Chinese-Q-Bench/), [Repo](https://github.com/Q-Future/Chinese-Q-Bench) The first attempt to test multi-lingual abilities on low-level vision.
